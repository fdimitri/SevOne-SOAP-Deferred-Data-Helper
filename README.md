# SevOne-SOAP-Deferred-Data-Helper
PHP script to assist in inserting data/getting data from SevOne.

This makes using the SevOne API much easier, specifically for
Deferred Data though I have since expanded it to deal with many
other things. If I can find newer copies of the script I'll put
them in here.
